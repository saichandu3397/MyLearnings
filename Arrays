Arrays:


Array is a data structure consiting of collection of elements

all elements in the array are of same type
they are placed contiguosly in memory
each element can be identified uniquely based on their location(0,1,2,3 indexed based we can indenty the elements at a particular position)
size of the array is fixed


Types of Array:
1D array
Multidimensional Array--- 2D,3D,....


Arrays in memory:


1D Array:

array elements in memory are located contiguosly

2D Array:

two dimension array in memory are located contiguosly in the form of 1D array in single array

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

in memory
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 
 3D memory
 
 same as 2D array in memory are located contiguosly in the fomr of 1D array
 
 
 Creating an Array:
 Declare:  creates a reference to an array -- creates a reference variable to array
 Instantiation of an array: creates an array-- system allocated n contiguos cells in the memory and adrress of the first cell is store in referecned variable created in previous step
 Initialization:  assing values  to cells in array
 
 datatype[] arr;
 arr =  new datatype[]
 arr[0]=10;
 arr[1]=10;
 
 
 Insertion in Array:
