In Async methods , the uncaught expetions are by default intercepted by simpleaysncexceptionhandler which logs the uncaught exception


@Async method return type can be void or we can wrap the result of the method in Future instance


@Async
public Future<String> asyncMethodWithReturnType(){}


Spring provides AsyncResult Class which implement Future


we can track the result of async excecution using this class
