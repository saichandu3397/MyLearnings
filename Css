CSS Box Model:

All html elements can be considered as box elements
it consists of content , padding , borders , margin

When u set width and height of properties of the element then ur setting only content area width and height of the content area

to include the total width and height of an element then u need to include padding and margin


Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border

The margin property also affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but the margin is not included in the actual size of the box. The box's total width and height stops at the border.



CSS Position:

static :

Default Value,
Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow

absolute:
The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element

relative:
The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position	

fixed:
The element is positioned relative to the browser window	


sticky:
The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
