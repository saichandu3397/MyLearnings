In order to use Ehcache first we need to configure CacheManager and cache through xml or java configuration

EHCache CacheManager should be shared (as a singleton at the VM level) or independent (typically local within the application).

overflowToDisk sets whether element can overflow to disk when the memory store has reached the maximum limit


CahceManagerEventListner::::
 Specifies a cacheManagerEventListnerFactory which is notified  when caches are added or removed from the cache
 The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.
 Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.
 
 
 The events include:
    * adding a Cache
    * removing a Cache
    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility
    of the implementer to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues
    depending on what their listener is doing.
    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.

Cache Configuration:::::
 name:: sets the name of the cahce.it is used to identify the cache and it must be unique
 
 maxEntriesLocalHeap--
 
  Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.  0 = no limit.
    In practice no limit means Integer.MAX_SIZE (2147483647) unless the cache is distributed
    with a Terracotta server in which case it is limited by resources.
    
 MaxEntriesLocalDisk-----
 Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.
 
 
   eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.
    
  optional Attributes
  
  
  
    overflowToOffHeap:
    (boolean) This feature is available only in enterprise versions of Ehcache.
    When set to true, enables the cache to utilize off-heap memory
    storage to improve performance. Off-heap memory is not subject to Java
    GC. The default value is false.
