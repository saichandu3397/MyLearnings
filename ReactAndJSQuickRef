Types :

primitives : when u access primitives u directly work on their value

string , number , boolean , null , undefined , symbol , bigin

Symbols and BigInts cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that donâ€™t support them natively.


Complex  : 

When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

Object , array , function



References :

use const to your references

because const variables cannot be reassinged if not can lead to bugs and difficult to comprenhed the code


if you want to reassign the variables the use let instead of const


let and const are block scoped where as var is function scoped



Objects :

use literal syntax for object creation instead of constructor

use const a = {} insted of const a = new Object();


Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.

prefer object spread syntax for the shallow copy insted of Object.assign




Destructuring: 

use desctructuring when accessing the multiple elements
